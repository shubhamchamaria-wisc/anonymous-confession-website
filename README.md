(2014) A completely anonymous confessions website I built in my spare time.
An admin could create pages/groups and people could anonymously post information.
Essentially, it was to share information in a specific group without revealing identities.

The idea behind the project could've worked but in today's world where cyber-bullying is a big issue, I felt that the website promoted the worst in us by holding nobody accountable.
Eventually, I decided to shelve the project due to these issues. However, the code is fully functional and pretty close to a beta version. (design, efficiency and security could be improved)
